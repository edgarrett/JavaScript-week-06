# JavaScript-week-06

This is the project that ends the Javascript portion of the BootCamp.
It will Create a 52 card deck of cards & Shuffle it. Two players get 26 cards each.
High card wins as they turn their cards up. They play until one player has no cards. 
It will Evaluate won each high card winner at a time and tell us which player won that deal and the score.
Some times there is a tie.
